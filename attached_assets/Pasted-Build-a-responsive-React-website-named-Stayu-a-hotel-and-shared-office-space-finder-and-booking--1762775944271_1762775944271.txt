Build a responsive React website named “Stayu” — a hotel and shared office space finder and booking platform with Clerk authentication and a cash-based booking system. 🧩 Overview: Stayu helps users search, view, and book hotels or shared office spaces easily. Instead of online payments, it uses a simple “Pay in Cash at Arrival” system. Data can be stored temporarily in localStorage or mock JSON files since there’s no backend. 🖥️ Tech Stack: React (Vite) for the frontend Tailwind CSS for modern, clean styling Clerk for authentication (login, signup, profile) React Router for navigation Local JSON / localStorage for mock data 📄 Pages: Home Page – Hero banner with “Find Your Perfect Stay” text Search bar for location, date, and price range “Featured Spaces” section showing example listings Browse / Search Page – Displays available spaces (from local JSON or state) Filter by city, price, and amenities Details Page – Shows selected space details, image, description, price, and a “Book Now” button Booking Page – Lets user pick date/time and confirm booking On confirm → show message “Booking Confirmed — Pay in Cash at Arrival” Save booking info in localStorage linked to Clerk user Dashboard Page – Shows logged-in user’s bookings from localStorage Option to cancel a booking Admin Page (Mock) – Display all bookings stored locally (for demo) 🎨 UI / Design: Use white + light blue theme Rounded cards, subtle shadows, hover animations Sticky top Navbar with: Left: Logo text “Stayu” Right: Login/Signup via Clerk Footer with “© Stayu 2025 — All Rights Reserved” 💸 Payment System: Only Cash Payment supported After booking → show confirmation message: "Your booking is confirmed.
